            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>It is an excellent conſideration, which is vſually brought to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. If Almighty God ſhould giue leaue, for once only in the Moneth, that all ſuch as would, might enter into his preſence to ſpeake with him; and that then, he would giue them glad and gratefull audience, &amp; would grant their ſuites: without doubt, it ought to be highly eſteemed, ſince it would be highly eſteemed if any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall King ſhould offer it. But then how much more is it fit, that we value it, as we ought, comming from the hand of God: eſpecially ſince he offreth it, and inuiteth vs to it, not only for once in the moneth, but for euery day, yea and many tymes in the ſame day. <hi>Veſpere, &amp; mane, &amp; meridie, narrabo,</hi>

                  <hi>&amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciabo, &amp; exaudiet vocem meam,</hi> ſayth the Prophet imbracing all tymes, by this ſpeach of his. At night, in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, at mid-day, and in the euening, I will relate, &amp; repreſent my troubles &amp;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:173307:21"/>my miſeries to Almighty God: &amp; I am full of confidence, that wherſoeuer &amp; whenſoeuer I ſhall reſort to him, he will heare me, &amp; do me fauour. God is not weary to haue vs aske of him, as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vſe to be: becauſe he growes not poore by giuing, as they vſe to do. For man how much more he giueth to another, ſo much the leſſe remaines to himſelfe, ſo that he takes from himſelfe, what he giues to them, and he impoueriſheth himſelfe, aſmuch as he enricheth them.</p>
               <p>And from hence it is, that men grow weary and diſguſted, when they are peſtered with ſuiters; and if they giue twice, or thrice, with a good will, they will yet be weary, againſt the next tyme, and eyther they giue no more, or els they do it, in ſuch a faſhion, as that it may be the laſt. But God as the Apoſtle <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſayth,<note place="margin">

               <p>And ſo there are ſome Authors who are reprehended, and euen prohibited, becauſe they would needs teach, that, which could neither be taught, nor learned; and reduce that to Art, which is aboue all art; as if they could infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly place a man in ſtate of <hi>Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Which <hi>Gerſon</hi> doth well repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,<note place="margin">Gerſon.</note> in a book which he wrote againſt <hi>Rusbrokius,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>Thou haſte pluckt of the flower, from the roote.</hi> For as the flowers pluckt from the roote, and carried in the hand, do quickly wither, &amp; looſe their beauty; ſo do theſe things, which God communicateth to the ſoule, after an internall manner, in this

For this, is the end of the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> and the <hi>Fruite,</hi> which muſt be drawen, out of all thoſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and diſcourſes of the <hi>Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi> All I this ſay muſt be ordained, to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:173307:36"/>moue the <hi>Will,</hi> to a deſire of that which is good, &amp; a deteſtation of that which is bad. And therfore, is the name of <hi>the three Powers,</hi> giuen to this firſt <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,</hi> becauſe it is the firſt, wherein this manner of <hi>Prayer</hi> is taught; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, theſe <hi>three Powers of the ſoule,</hi> are to be imployed in all the other <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes</hi> following, as well as in this.</p>
               <p>This kind of <hi>Prayer,</hi> which here our <hi>B. Father</hi> teacheth, and which the <hi>Society</hi> vſeth, is not ſubiect to any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, nor hath it any thing in it, which may carry any proportion to illuſions, as ſome others haue. But it is a Kind, which is very playne, and much vſed by the ancient Fathers; &amp; very conforme to mans nature, which is diſcurſiue, and rationall, and which gouernes it ſelfe by reaſon; and is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, conuinced, and ſubdued by it; and conſequently it is moſt eaſy, moſt fruitfull, and moſt ſafe. So that we are not to remaine in our <hi>Prayer,</hi> like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who had giuen ouer our ſelues; or as if we were extraordinarily illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, without doing any thing on our part, for this would be a great
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:173307:37"/>errour and abuſe: But we are to call vpon God, by meanes of the <hi>Exerciſe of our powers,</hi> and we are gently, to coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate with him; becauſe God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to require the cooperation of his creatures; &amp; this is that, which our <hi>B. Father</hi> teacheth vs, in his booke of the <hi>ſpirituall Exerciſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe other kinds of <hi>Prayer,</hi> which take away all diſcourſe, and which vſe certaine <hi>negations,</hi> with certaine <hi>ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and are taken out of <hi>Mysticall Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> are not vſually to be taught, no nor ſo much as to be ſought,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.</note> as was ſaid before. And new beginners who haue not proceeded far, in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their <hi>Paſsions,</hi> and in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of <hi>Vertue,</hi> being directed into theſe particuler ways, are made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to illuſions, and deceytes. And when they thinke they haue gayned much vpon themſelues, they find by experience, that all their paſſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine entire, which by meanes of that ſweet bayte, and guſte of <hi>Prayer,</hi> lay a while, as if they had beene aſleepe, but afterward they awake, with much danger to the owners. Beſides, that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:173307:37"/>by theſe particuler, and ſingular kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of <hi>Prayer,</hi> there is created in men, a kind of ſtiffnes, and cloſnes to their owne Iudgment, which is a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, towards a mans being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. And therefore our <hi>B. F. Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> did apprehend it much; and he ſaid, that ordinarily, ſuch perſons haue a touch of this.</p>
               <p>I ſay therefore, that the <hi>first thing</hi> which we are to do in <hi>Prayer,</hi> in any <hi>Pointe</hi> which we ſhall take in hand, muſt be to place, before our <hi>memory,</hi> that <hi>point,</hi> or <hi>myſtery,</hi> vpon which we meane to make our <hi>Prayer;</hi> then we muſt enter into <hi>Meditation,</hi> by diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with the <hi>Vnderſtanding,</hi> vpon the particularityes of that <hi>myſtery,</hi> &amp; then come in, the affects of the <hi>Will.</hi> So that the Memory firſt propounds, &amp; then inſtantly enters Diſcourſe, and <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of the <hi>Vnderſtanding;</hi> for this is the ground, from whence all thoſe acts &amp; Exerciſes, are to flowe, which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in <hi>Prayer;</hi> and in the vertue and ſtrength of this, all the reſt is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſon of this is cleere, in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:173307:38"/>good <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> For our <hi>Will</hi> is a blind kind of <hi>Power,</hi> which cannot ſtir a foote, vnleſſe it be guided by the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Nihil volitum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>niſi praecogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> This is a common maxime of the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> The <hi>Will</hi> cannot deſire that thing, which hath not already paſſed by the <hi>Vnderstanding;</hi> which is as the <hi>Page</hi> with a torch in his hand, who goes before, to giue light to the <hi>Will,</hi> &amp; guides it, and diſcouereth to it, what it is to <hi>loue,</hi> or what to hate. And ſo <hi>S. Augustine</hi> ſayth, <hi>Inuiſa diligi poſſe, incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita nequaquam.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. li. <hi>10.</hi> de Tri. c. <hi>1.</hi> Greg. ho. <hi>36.</hi> ſuper Euangel.</note> And <hi>S.

And ſo, when we deſire, that any man ſhould chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge his will, and purpoſe, we perſwade
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:173307:38"/>him with reaſon, and we procure to conuince his <hi>Vnderſtanding,</hi> that the thing which he deſires, is not conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, nor good; and that the other thing is better, and more conuenient; that ſo he may forſake the one, and imbrace the other. So that the act, &amp; diſcourſe of the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> is the foundation &amp; ground, of thoſe other acts, and <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> which we make in <hi>Prayer;</hi> and therfore is <hi>Meditation</hi> ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.

               <p>A good ſeruant of God, was wont to ſay to this purpoſe, That in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, there were to be but two kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of priſons, in any Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth.<note place="margin">Note.</note> The one of the <hi>Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> the other for <hi>Mad-men.</hi> For eyther a man belieues, that there is a <hi>Hell,</hi> made for ſuch as ſin, or no.

               <p>There is no doubt, but that if ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly men conſidered this, it would be a ſtrong bridle to reſtrayne them from ſinne.

               <p>IT will be of great profit to vs, that in tyme of <hi>Prayer,</hi> we exerciſe our ſelues, in the affects and deſires of our <hi>Will,</hi> of which part we ſhall ſhortly treat. But it is very needfull withall, that theſe affects and deſires, go very well grounded in reaſon, and in truth; becauſe man is a rationall creature, and wil be guided by reaſon, &amp; by the way of <hi>Vnderstanding.</hi> And therefore,<note place="margin">Note.</note> one of the principall things, to which we muſt ordayne, and addreſſe <hi>Meditation,</hi> muſt be, that we may remaine very ſoundly <hi>vnbeguiled,</hi> and fully poſſeſſed, with the knowledge of thoſe things,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:173307:43"/>which are really true; and perfectly conuinced, and reſolued, concerning what is beſt for vs. We vſe to ſay, when one is reduced to leade an orderly and good life, that he is <hi>vnbeguiled.</hi> This <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beguiling,</hi> is therefore to be one of the principall fruites, which we muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to gather from <hi>Prayer.</hi> And this point, muſt be much noted, becauſe it is of very great importance, in this matter. And eſpecially, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a ſpirituall life, it is neceſſary that a man exerciſe himſelfe much in this; to the end that he may go on, well grounded, and poſſeſſed, with a firme beliefe of things, which really are true.</p>
               <p>To the end, that we may better draw this benefit from <hi>Meditation,</hi> and that it may be of much profit to vs, it wilbe neceſſary that it be not ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, nor curſorily made; nor yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a dull, and dead faſhion; but with life, and with much attention, and reſt of mind.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:173307:43"/>how the arriuall of death, makes an end of them all; that ſo you may deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe all worldly things, and place your whole harte, vpon that which is to laſt for euer. You are to conſider, and ponder often, what a vaine, and idle thing, the eſtimation and opinion of men is, which maketh ſuch fierce war vpon vs. For it neither giues any thing to you, nor takes any thing from you, nor can it make you, a whit better, or worſe. Grow you thus to deſpiſe it, &amp; make no reckoning at all therof. And the ſame, is to be done in the reſt.

                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> For the wiſe man, knoweth a thing after one faſhion; and the ſimple and ignorant man, after another.

Thomas</hi> ſayth, in <hi>Meditation;</hi> and it is, that true <hi>Deuotion</hi> ſprings from thence; a thing ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in ſpirituall life, and ſo much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by all them who walke that way. <hi>Deuotion</hi> is no other thing, but a <hi>Prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptitude and readineſſe of will, towards all that, which is good.</hi> And therefore a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute man is he, who is ready and diſpoſed for all goodneſſe. And this is the generall doctrine of the <hi>Saints. S. Thomas</hi> ſayth moreouer, that there are two cauſes of this <hi>Deuotion,</hi> the one is <hi>extrinſecall</hi> which is God, &amp; that is the principall. The other is <hi>intrinſecall</hi> on our part, which is <hi>Meditation.</hi> For this <hi>prompt and ready will,</hi> towards the actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of vertue, doth grow from the <hi>conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> and <hi>Meditation</hi> of the <hi>Vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:173307:46"/>and this is that, which next after the grace of God, may be truly ſaid to kindle and blow the fire in our hart.</p>
               <p>So that true <hi>Deuotion</hi> and feruour of ſpirit,<note place="margin">Note.</note> doth not conſiſte in the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and ſenſible guſte, wherof ſome haue experience, and ſenſe in <hi>Prayer;</hi> but in hauing a <hi>will,</hi> which is <hi>prompte</hi> and <hi>ready preſt,</hi> towards all thoſe things which concerne the ſeruice of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. And this is the <hi>deuotion,</hi> which continues and laſts, whileſt the other comes quickly to an end. For that, doth but conſiſt of certaine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſenſible deuotion, which riſe from a quicke deſire, which one hath, of any thing which is deſirable, and amiable. And many tymes it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from a mans naturall complexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in that he hath a ſweet diſpoſition, and a tender hart, which is quickly moued towards ſoftneſſe, and tears; &amp; when this kind of deuotion is once dropped downe, the good purpoſes, are aſſoone dryed vp. This is but a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der kind of loue, which is grounded in guſtes, and conſolations; and as long as that guſte, and deuotion laſts, the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:173307:47"/>man wilbe very diligent, and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall; and he wilbe a friend of ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and recolection. But when that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion is ended, there is an end of all. Whereas they, who are ſo groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>Truth</hi> by meanes of <hi>Meditation</hi> and <hi>conſideration;</hi> and are conuinced, &amp; diſabuſed by ſolide reaſon; theſe are the men, who continue and perſeuere in vertue: and although thoſe guſtes &amp; conſolations faile them, yet they are ſtill the ſame, that they were before: becauſe the ſame cauſe and reaſon laſts, which at the firſt induced, &amp; moued them to it.</p>
               <p>This is a maſculine, &amp; ſtrong kind of loue, and by this <hi>Touch of triall,</hi> the true ſeruants of God are ſeene: &amp; not in thoſe guſts, and conſolations. They are wonte to ſay, that our paſſions are like certaine little dogs, which ſtand barking at vs; and in the tyme of ſpirituall conſolation, they haue their mouthes muzled vp. And make account that God doth caſte certaine bits of bread, before euery one of them, and with that, they are quiet, &amp; craue nothing: but take you away that bread
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:173307:47"/>of conſolation, and then one of them, will begin to barke, and the other of them wilbe as ſure to follow, and then is the tyme to ſee, how euery one doth carry himſelfe. They alſo compare theſe guſtes, and conſolations, to <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable goods,</hi> &amp; <hi>chattels,</hi> which are ſoone ſpent: but ſolide vertues, are as <hi>freehold,</hi> or <hi>land of inheritance,</hi> which continues and laſts, &amp; ſo they are of more price.</p>
               <p>From hence groweth a <hi>Truth,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we take experience many tymes, &amp; it is worthy of conſideration.<note place="margin">Note.</note> We ſee ſome perſons, who on the one ſide, haue great comforts in their <hi>Prayer;</hi> and afterward, in temptations &amp; other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of ſinne, we ſee them weake, and fallen. And on the contrary part, we ſee others, who ſuffer great dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in <hi>Prayer,</hi> and know not what belongs to any ſpirituall conſolation, or guſte; and yet we find theſe laſt, to be ſtronge, when they are tempted, &amp; far from falling. The cauſe of this, is that, which we were ſaying before. That the former ſort of men, did ground themſelues in guſts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde feelings; but the latter, laide
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:173307:48"/>their foundation vpon reaſon, &amp; were diſabuſed, conuinced, and poſſeſſed with the reall truth of thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>; and with that, they laſt, and perſeuere in thoſe things, which formerly they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue.</p>
               <p>So that one of the meanes, and that a very good one, which vſually we giue, to make men perſeuere, in thoſe good purpoſes which they conceiue in <hi>Prayer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> and to put them in execution, is; That men muſt procure to conſerue in memory, the motiue and reaſon, which cauſed that good deſire, and purpoſe in them, formerly; for that which moued them before, to deſire it, will helpe them afterwards to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, &amp; put it in execution. Nay there is more in this, then what is ſaid. For when a man goeth thus <hi>vnbeguiling,</hi> &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uincing himſelfe, in <hi>Prayer,</hi> although afterward he remember not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly the <hi>medium,</hi> or <hi>reaſon</hi> which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him then, yet in vertue of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene <hi>vnbeguiled</hi> before, and of the reſolution which then he tooke, being conuinced by truth and reaſon he continueth firme and ſtrong, to

               <p>This is the duty of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and this is the Fruit, which we muſt reape fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence.

Well then; before any man enter into Prayer he is to conſider thus with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, at good leaſure. What is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſpirituall neceſſity, that I am ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:173307:62"/>too: What is that, which hindreth my proceeding moſt, and maketh moſt warre agaynſt my ſoule. And this is that, which we are to thinke of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and to place it before our eyes, &amp; to inſiſt vpon it; to fetch the remedy thereof, out of our Prayer. And the prouiding and preparing of the <hi>Points</hi> of our <hi>Meditation</hi> muſt be addreſſed to that purpoſe. I wil giue you an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple.</p>
               <p>I finde in my ſelfe, a great incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be valued and eſteemed, and that men ſhould make much accompt of me; and that humaine reſpects vſe to tranſport me much; and that, when any occaſion is offered, whereby my ſelfe to be vndervalued, I feele it, and I am troubled much, and perhaps ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes, I make ſhow therof.

               <p>Well, if your greateſt neceſſity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in this, <hi>remedy</hi> muſt ſtand in ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, and rooting vp this imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

               <p>To the end that there may be no excuſe in this, it is to be noted.

An occaſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelfe to you of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forming your ſelues to the will of God, in all that which he ſhall diſpoſe, and ordayne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning you; deteyne your ſelues in it, as long as you can; for this will be a very good Prayer, and very well imployed, and will no way blunt the lance; wherewith you meane to take <hi>Humility,</hi> but will rather ſharpen the point therof.</p>

               <p>One of the reaſons, why ſome do not profit ſo much in <hi>Prayer,</hi> is becauſe they are faulty in this point, and go leaping and skipping on the acts of ſeuerall vertues, ſaying within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; heere an act of <hi>Humility</hi> comes well in, and then they make an act of of Humility, &amp; then away; then they thinke it is to the purpoſe, if they make an act of <hi>Obedience,</hi> and then they make an act of <hi>Obedience;</hi> and ſhortly

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:173307:71"/>giueth vs a new kind of guſte. Euen ſo, to the end that we may continue a long tyme in demaund of the ſame thing in <hi>Prayer,</hi> which is the very food and ſuſtenance of our ſoule, it is a good way, to dreſſe it, in different ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners. This we may do ſome tymes, by paſſing, from one conſideration, to another: or from one <hi>Point</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as we ſaid euen now. For euery tyme that a man moues himſelfe, and actuates vpon the ſame thinge, by a different reaſon, or conſideration, it is like dreſſing it, after another faſhion, &amp; it growes to be like a new diſh of meate.</p>
               <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Note.</note> although there ſhould be no new reaſon, or conſideration at hand, yet the affect and deſire of the ſame vertue, may, in it ſelfe, be dreſſed ſeuerall wayes. As if one pretend to get <hi>Humility,</hi> ſome tymes he may be deteyning his minde, in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his owne miſery &amp; weaknes; deſpiſing and confounding himſelfe for that. At other tymes, he may enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne himſelf in a deſire to be diſeſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and deſpiſed by others, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:173307:72"/>any account of the opinion, and eſtimation of men; but holding it all to be meere vanity. At other tymes, he may be giuing himſelfe confuſion, and ſhame, to ſee the faults, wherin he daily takes himſelfe; and to aske both pardon, and redreſſe of them, at the hands of God. At other times, he may do it, by admiting the goodneſſe of God, which endureth him; whereas yet ſometimes, we can hardly endure, euen our very ſelues. At other tymes by giuing him thanks, for not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vs to fall, into more grieuous crymes. And by this variety, &amp; diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Acts, that faſtidiouſnes (which vſually is cauſed by continuance of the ſame thing) may be auoided; and it may grow to be of facility, &amp; guſte, to continue, and perſeuer in the acts, and affects of the ſame vertue, by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes wherof, it growes to take deeper roote, and more entire poſſeſſion of the hart. For as the <hi>Fyle,</hi> euery tyme that it paſſeth vpon the <hi>Iron,</hi> carryes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what with it; ſo euery tyme that we produce any act of <hi>Humility,</hi> or other vertue, ſome part of the contrary vice,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:173307:72"/>is diminiſhed, and diſcharged therby.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, there is another meanes to make vs perſeuere, in deſire of the ſame thing in <hi>Prayer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> many daies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, which is both very eaſy, and very profitable; and this is, by diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to particuler caſes. The teachers of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the way of <hi>Spirit,</hi> do note, that we muſt not content our ſelues, to draw from <hi>Prayer,</hi> a <hi>generall Purpoſe</hi> to ſerue God; or only to proceed in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and to be perfect, at large; but that we muſt deſcend in particuler, to that wherein we know or conceiue, that we may moſt pleaſe, and ſerue our Lord. Neither yet, are we to content our ſelues with, conceauing any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall deſire of any particular vertue, as namely to be <hi>humble,</hi> to be <hi>obedient,</hi> to be <hi>patient,</hi> or to be <hi>mortifyed,</hi> becauſe this kinde of deſire, or rather velleity of any vertue, is intertayned thus in generall, euen by vicious men. For as <hi>vertue</hi> is truly beautifull, &amp; honorable, and of great vſe, not only for the next, but euen alſo for this life; ſo it is an eaſy thing to loue it, and to deſire it, in ſuch a generall manner. But we,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:173307:73"/>when we meditate vpon that vertue which we deſire, muſt diſcend to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler caſes.</p>
               <p>As for example; if we pretend to obteyne a great <hi>Conformity</hi> with the will of God, we muſt deſcend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our ſelues, with his will, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler things; aſwell in ſicknes, as in health; aſwell in death, as in life; aſwell in tentation, as in conſolation. If we pretend to obteyne the vertue of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> we muſt alſo deſcend to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culers, by imagining ſuch caſes, as may be preſented, or which vſe to offer the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, for our being deſpiſed, or diſeſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and ſo, in the reſt of the Vertues. For theſe are thoſe particulers, which are vſually moſt felt, and wherein the difficulty of the vertue doth moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; and wherby a man is beſt diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and proued; and theſe are alſo the meanes, wherby vertue, is beſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned.</p>
               <p>We muſt alſo procure to begin to make our firſt inſtances, by thoſe things, which are of the leſſer ſorte, &amp; more eaſy; &amp; we are afterward to riſe to the more hard, wherein we thinke
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:173307:73"/>we ſhould haue more difficulty, if the occaſion were offered; &amp; ſo to go ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſomewhat, &amp; riſing vp by little, and little, from the leſſe, to the greater. And we muſt actuate in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, as if we had them preſent with vs; &amp; that, ſo long, as that nothing which concernes the Vertue to which we pretend, may preſent it ſelfe to vs, <hi>to which we may not boldly make head, and ſo the field remaine ours.</hi> And when any reall, and true occaſions do occur, we muſt firſt imploy our ſelues in them, diſpoſing our ſelues to manage them well, and with profit, euery one, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ſtate. A good ſeruant of God, did alſo add this aduiſe, that in <hi>Prayer</hi> we ſhould propound ſomething in particuler, concerning ſuch, or ſuch a Vertue, which we ſhould act that day. So low as this, do they ſay, that we muſt deſcend in <hi>Prayer.</hi>

We find that anciently in thoſe <hi>Monasteryes</hi> of <hi>Monkes,</hi> there were ſo many perſons of great <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Contemplation;</hi> and now you ſhall haue difficulty, to find a man of great <hi>Prayer;</hi> and when you ſhall ſpeake to men of <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templation;</hi> it ſeemes to them, as if you were talking of <hi>Metaphiſicks,</hi> or <hi>Moriſco's,</hi> which is not to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:173307:81"/>
               <p>The cauſe hereof is, for that ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe holy <hi>Monks</hi> did exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues much in <hi>Prayer;</hi> and the young men who entred into thoſe <hi>Monaſteryes,</hi> were preſently tasked, and inſtructed therein, and were made to practiſe it much, as we read in the rule of <hi>S.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:173307:82"/>wherof he tooke that pointe to be.</p>
               <p>Another thing alſo, is to help vs much, towards our continuance in this exerciſe of Prayer, and to perſeuer in it much; and this is, to haue a great <hi>loue</hi> to God, and to ſpirituall things. And ſo ſaid the Royall Prophet; <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo dilexi legem tuam Domine? tot a die meditatio mea eſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.47.</note> So that, if we did loue God much, we alſo would be glad to be thinking of him day and night, and we ſhould not want matter wherof to thinke. Oh with how good a will, doth the mother ſtand thinking of that Childe of her wombe,<note place="margin">Note.</note> whome ſhe tenderly loues? And how little need hath ſhe of diſcourſes, or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, to comfort herſelfe, in the thought of him?

                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:173307:82"/>her eyes, without any more diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or conſiderations.

               <p>Now if theſe effects can be wroght, by this naturall kinde of loue; (why do I ſay Naturall loue?) nay if we ſee that the furious loue of ſome loſt and wretched creature, doth carry him ſo abſorpt, and inebriated vpon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whome he loues, as that he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes vnable, euen to thinke of any thing els; how much more ſhould the ſupernaturall Loue of that infinite Goodneſſe, and Beauty of our Lord God, be able to produce theſe effects?

                  <note place="margin">Cap. <hi>4.</hi> &amp; ſeqq.</note> wherof we ſpake before, is a moſt particuler guifte of God; which he imparteth, not to all, but only to ſuch as it pleaſeth him. But this ordinary, and playne <hi>Mentall
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:173307:83"/>Prayer,</hi> wherof now we treat, our Lord denieth to none. And it is the errour of ſome, that becauſe they obteyne not that other rich <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,</hi> it ſeemes to them, that they cannot pray at all, and that they are not fit, for this holy exerciſe; whereas yet euen this, is a very good, and very profitable kind of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and with it we may become <hi>perfect.</hi> And if our Lord be pleaſed, to impart that other <hi>high</hi> Prayer vnto vs, this inferiour kind of Prayer is a very good, and a very proper diſpoſition, for the obteyning of it. I will therefore now declare how, with the grace of our Lord, it is in our hand to make this Prayer, euer well, and to gather <hi>Fruite</hi> from thence, which is a matter of much comfort.</p>
               <p>By two meanes we may very well inferre thus much, vpon that which hath beene ſaid. The firſt is, becauſe the manner of Prayer which our <hi>B. Father</hi> hath taught vs, is to exerciſe therein the <hi>Three powers of our ſoule;</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, with our <hi>Memory,</hi> before the eyes of our <hi>Vnderſtanding,</hi> the <hi>Point</hi> or <hi>Miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> vpon which we meane to make our
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:173307:84"/>Prayer; and then to enter in, with out <hi>Vnderſtanding</hi> it ſelfe, <hi>diſcourſing, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> and <hi>conſidering</hi> thoſe things which may ſerue moſt for the mouing of our <hi>Will;</hi> and then are the affects and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of the <hi>Will</hi> it ſelfe to follow: and this third, we haue already ſaid, to be the chiefe part, and <hi>Fruite,</hi> which we are to gather from Prayer. So that Prayer, conſiſteth not, in that ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and ſenſible guſte, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes we feele, and do experiment within our ſelues; but in the acts which we make, with the <hi>powers of our ſoules.</hi> Now the doing of this, is euer in our power, though we be neuer ſo dry, and diſcomforted. For although I ſhould be more dry then any ſticke,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and more hard then any ſtone, yet would it be in my power (with the fauour of our Lord) to make an act of deteſtation, and <hi>griefe</hi> for my ſins; and an act of the <hi>Loue</hi> of God; and an act of <hi>Patience,</hi> and an act of <hi>Humility;</hi> and to deſire to be diſgraced, and deſpiſed, in imitation of Chriſt our Lord, who would needs be diſgraced, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for loue of me.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:173307:84"/>
               <p>It muſt heere be alſo obſerued, that the buſineſſe of making good Prayer, and the <hi>Fruite</hi> therof, doth not conſiſt, in that one make ſo much as theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry acts themſelues, with guſte, or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible conſolation; nor in that he feele much, euen of what he is doing; nor doth the goodneſſe and perfection of the <hi>acts</hi> themſelues, nor the merit which followes vpon them, conſiſt in this. This I ſay, is to be noted much. For it vſeth to be an errour, very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to many, who diſcomfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as conceauing, that they do no good in <hi>Prayer,</hi> becauſe they feele not ſo much actuall ſorrow for their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and ſins, or ſo great affection &amp; deſire of vertue, as they would. But theſe feelings do belong to the <hi>Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Appetite;</hi> whereas the <hi>Will</hi> is a <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Power,</hi> and dependeth not vpon the other. And therefore there is no neceſſity, that a man ſhould feele his owne acts, in ſuch a faſhion; but it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth that they be produced by the <hi>Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo the Deuines, &amp; Saints who treat of <hi>Contrition,</hi> and <hi>Griefe for ſin,</hi> do
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:173307:85"/>thus comfort their pennitents: Who comming to make great account of the greuiouſnes of mortall ſinne, are diſcomforted, for not being able to diſſolue themſelues in teares; nor to feele in themſelues, that ſenſible griefe which they deſire. For they could find in their harts, that euen their very bowels, might ſplit in their bodyes, for ſorrow of their ſins. And thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ſay, <hi>That True contrition &amp; griefe, conſiſteth not in the ſenſitiue Appetite, but in the Will.</hi> Let it trouble you to haue ſinned, becauſe ſinne is the offence of God, who is worthy to be loued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone all things; for this is true <hi>Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> That other <hi>feeling,</hi> when our Lord ſhall impart it, do your receiue it with giuing of thanks; and when he doth not, be not troubled, for God exacteth not that of you. For it is euident, that he is not to exact that of vs, which is not in our power; and that kind of <hi>feeling,</hi> which you would haue, is a guſte and ſenſible deuotion, which is not in your power. Therfore God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth not that of vs, but he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth, that which is in our power,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:173307:85"/>which is, the <hi>ſorrow</hi> of our <hi>Will,</hi> which hath no dependance vpon that other. And the ſame is to be ſaid of the acts of the <hi>Loue of God.</hi> Loue you God aboue al things, with your <hi>Will,</hi> for this is that ſtrong and <hi>appreciatiue Loue,</hi> and that which God exacteth of vs. That o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is a <hi>tender kind of loue,</hi> which is not in our power. The ſame is to be ſaid of the acts of other vertues, and of all the good purpoſes, which we haue.</p>
               <p>This truth is clerely ſeene by the contrary. For it is moſt certayne,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that if a man do, with his will, deſire, and conſent to a mortall ſinne, although the ſame man, haue no other feeling nor take no other guſte therein, yet he ſhall ſinne mortally, and ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to be condemned for it, to hell.

Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince God is more ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vertue, then to puniſh vice. Nay, many tymes, theſe acts, are more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, and more acceptable to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:173307:86"/>God, when they are done, after that dry manner, without guſte, or ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſolation; becauſe they are more pure, and more durable, &amp; a man pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more of his owne ſtocke, and he is at more coſt (as a man may ſay) then when he is carried on, by ſenſible deuotion. And ſo it is a ſigne of more ſolide Vertue, and of a <hi>Will</hi> more firme, and faythfull, to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God. For he, who without thoſe helpes of guſtes, and ſpirituall conſolations, doth make thoſe acts; what would he do with them?</p>
               <p>Father <hi>Auila</hi> ſayth very well,<note place="margin">M. Auila.</note>

So that, as men, who goe by <hi>Galleys</hi> in deepe ſeas, when the wind comes to fayle them, do make their way by the force of <hi>Oares;</hi> ſo they
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:173307:86"/>who meane to exerciſe themſelues in <hi>Prayer,</hi> when the proſperous winde of the illuſtrations, and fauours of God, are wanting, muſt procure to paſſe on, by the <hi>Oares</hi> of the <hi>Powers of their ſoule,</hi> which ſtill are helped by the fauour of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> though not alwayes ſo copiouſly, as at ſome tymes.</p>

               <p>I ſay therfore, (applying the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to our purpoſe) that this,<note place="margin">Note.</note> by the grace of our Lord, will euer be in our power to do; becauſe we may ſtill be laying hold of thoſe things, wherof we haue moſt need.

               <p>So that we are not to put our ſelues in payne, for not being able to vſe much diſcourſe, or many conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, nor to haue other feelings and deuotions; becauſe <hi>Prayer,</hi> doth not conſiſt in this, but in the reſt.

               </head>
               <p>THERE are alſo other very eaſy wayes, which will helpe vs much, towards the hauing of good Prayer; wherby alſo it will appeare, that it is euer, in our power to haue good, and profitable <hi>Prayer;</hi> and that all, are capable of <hi>Mentall Prayer,</hi> and that there is none, who may not vſe it.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt, it is very good to this purpoſe, which is aduiſed by ſome <hi>Maiſters of Spirit,</hi> who ſay, That we muſt not make our Prayer to be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fiction, or art; but we muſt do in that, as men do in buſineſſe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, who pawſe to thinke what they are about; and how their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:173307:89"/>ſpeeds, and how it may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter done. So the ſeruant of God, is playnly, and without tricks, to deale with himſelfe,<note place="margin">Note.</note> in point of Prayer, &amp; to ſay, <hi>How goes the buſineſse forward of the ſpirituall profit, and of the ſaluation of my ſoule?</hi> For this is our <hi>buſineſſe,</hi> and we are not continuing in this life, for any other true reaſon, but only to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate this affaire. Let therefore the <hi>religious man</hi> eſpecially, enter into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with himſelfe, &amp; let him thinke thus, at great leaſure. <hi>How goes my ſoule on in this buſineſſe? What fruite haue I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in theſe ten, twenty, thirty, or fourty years, that I haue beene in Religion? What is that, which I haue gained, or acquired in the vertue of Humility, or Mortification? I will ſee how the accounts do stand; and what I can anſwere to God, for all thoſe ſo great meaenes, and helpes, which I haue had in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, wherewith to thriue, and increaſe the Principall, and Talent, which he gaue me. And if hitherto I haue ill imployed my time, and not knowen how to ſerue my ſelfe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I will remedy the fault from henceforth; and certainly, my whole life shall not paſſe hereafter, as a great part therof, hath done hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto.</hi>

               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:173307:89"/>
               <p>In the ſame manner ought euery one in his condition, with great play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neneſſe and ſimplicity, and without all diſguiſe, make a pawſe to thinke in particuler, how it goes with him, in his place and duty; how he ſhalbe able to diſcharge it well, and according to the will of God; how he may carry his buſineſſe like a good Chriſtian, and gouerne his houſe and family, in ſuch ſort, as that all of it, may ſerue God. How he may make right vſe, &amp; beare thoſe difficulties with patience, which his condition, or office carry with it. In this, he will find inough to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to amend.

                  <hi>Iohn Gerſon</hi> telleth of a ſeruant of God, who was wonte to ſay thus, many tymes.<note place="margin">Guliel. Pariſ.</note> 
                  <hi>It is now fourty yeare ſince I haue frequented prayer, with all care I could; and I neuer found a better, nor a more briefe, and compendious meanes, towards the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of good</hi> Prayer, <hi>then to preſent my ſelf, in the preſence of God, like an infant, or like ſome poore blinde, naked, and abandoned beggar.</hi> We ſee that the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:173307:90"/>did vſe this kind of Prayer very often, calling himſelfe ſometymes <hi>a ſicke man,</hi> at other tymes an <hi>orphane,</hi> at other ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes a <hi>blindeman;</hi> and at others, <hi>a poore Creature,</hi> and <hi>a beggar.</hi> And of this, the Pſalmes are full. And we know by experience, that many, who haue vſed, and frequented this kinde of Prayer, haue come, by this meanes, to be indued with very high <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</hi> Do you therfore vſe it; and our Lord wilbe pleaſed, that by this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, you ſhall obteyne, what you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
               <p>The Prayer of the <hi>Beggar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> is a very good Prayer. Conſider, ſayth <hi>Gerſon,</hi> with how great humility and patience the poore man ſtands expecting a litle almes,<note place="margin">Gerſon de monte con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templat.</note> at the rich mans doore; and with what diligence he goes, where he knowes, there is any almes to be giuen.

                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:173307:90"/>our neceſſity, and our miſery; &amp; hoping for ſome remedy therof, at the hands of his liberality and bounty.<note place="margin">

               <p>We find in that ſtory, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of the Abbot <hi>Paphnutius,</hi> who liued in the moſt inward part of the deſert,<note place="margin">Pratum ſpiritual.</note> how that hauing heard of that looſe woman <hi>Thais,</hi> that ſhe was the ſnare and perdition of many ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and the cauſe alſo of many quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and the death of many; he did with deſire to conuert her, and drawe her to God, take the habit of a ſecular man, and money, and he went to the Citty, where ſhe dwelt, and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her. And he tooke the occaſion, from ſome words of hers, when (he ſeeming to deſire, that ſhe would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him ſome more priuate place)
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:173307:91"/>ſhe ſaid, <hi>Thou art ſafe inough heere, from the eyes of men, who cannot ſee the heere; From the eyes of God, indeed, thou canſt not hide thy ſelfe, how ſecret ſoeuer the place may be.</hi> The ſtory is large; but to come to that which makes to our purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The woman being conuerted, he conducted her to the wilderneſſe, and did ſhut her vp into a cell; and made it faſt with a ſeale of leade, leauing only an ouerture, in a very little win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow which there was, to the end that daily they might therby, giue her a little bread, and water. And <hi>Paphnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> leauing her, ſhe asked him only, how ſhe was to pray to God. To this, the holy <hi>Abbot</hi> anſwered: <hi>Thou doest not deſerue to take the Name of God into that impure mouth of thine, but the manner of thy Prayer shalbe this: Thou shalt put thy ſelfe vpon thy knees; and thou shalt turne thy ſelfe towards the Eaſt; and thou shalt repeal theſe words many tymes, Qui plaſmaſti me, miſerere mei;</hi> O thou who madeſt me, haue mercy on me. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhe continued three years, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out euer preſuming to take the name of God into her mouth; but alwayes
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:173307:91"/>carrying her many grieuous ſinnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her ſight, and demaunding mercy and pardon for them of our Lord, in thoſe words which the Saint had taught her.</p>
               <p>And this Prayer, was ſo acceptable to Almighty God, that the <hi>Abbot Paph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius,</hi> demaunding of the bleſſed <hi>Saint Anthony,</hi> at the end of thoſe three years, if he thought that God had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned her ſinners; <hi>S. Anthony</hi> called his Monks about him, and required them, that euery one ſhould remaine all the next night following by himſelfe, in <hi>Watching</hi> and <hi>Prayer;</hi> to the end that our Lord might declare that to ſome one of them, which was demaunded by <hi>Paphnutius.</hi> Being therfore all, in Prayer, <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>monke,</hi> who was the chiefe amongſt the diſciples of <hi>S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> had a viſion of a bed in heauen, adorned with moſt pretious furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and which was attended by foure virgins. As ſoone as he ſaw ſo rich an obiect, he inſtantly ſaid within himſelfe: This grace and fauour can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reſerued for any other, then for my father <hi>S. Anthony.</hi> As he was in theſe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:173307:92"/>thoughts, a voice deſcended from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and ſaid, <hi>This bed of glory, is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for thy Father Anthony, but for Thais the ſinner.</hi> And fifteene dayes after, our Lord was pleaſed to carry her to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy that glory, or celeſtiall bed of ſtate. Do you the while, content your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, with making this <hi>Prayer,</hi> &amp; know that you deſerue to make no other. And perhaps you may pleaſe God more by this, then if you made that other, which you imagine.</p>
               <p>In a certayne ſpirituall Diſcourſe which is a manuſcript, made by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious <hi>Monke</hi> of the <hi>Carthuſians,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>ſpirituall Communion,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth a certayne paſſage of our <hi>B. F. Ignatius,</hi> and his companions, which he affirmeth himſelfe to haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, from a perſon worthy to haue beene belieued. How that, whilſt they were trauelling as they vſed to do on foote, with their little bags, and ſuch like neceſſaryes, vnder their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes; and going towards <hi>Barcelona,</hi> there was a good honeſt man, trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling alſo in the ſame way, who ſaw them, and tooke pitty of them, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:173307:92"/>them, with great inſtance, that they would giue him their little bags; ſaying that he was luſty, and ſtrong, and would carry them well. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they refuſed to do ſo, yet at laſt, being importuned, they were content; and ſo, went on, their way, all together. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they arriued at their lodging, the <hi>Fathers,</hi> euery one of them, did procure to find out his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to recollect, and commend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to God, in <hi>Prayer.</hi> That other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, ſeeing them do ſo, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a corner alſo for himſelfe, and caſt himſelfe downe vpon his knees, like them. And proceeding afterward in their way, they asked him once: <hi>Brother, what do you vſe to do, in that corner of yours?</hi> He anſwered. <hi>That which I do, is to ſay, O Lord theſe men are ſaints, and I am but their beast. Looke what they do, and that will I alſo do. And this</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>am I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering vp to God.</hi> And the Story further ſayth that the good man did profit ſo much, by meanes of this <hi>Prayer,</hi> that he grew to be a very ſpirituall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to be of <hi>high Prayer,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Now who is he, that cannot vſe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:173307:93"/>this forme of <hi>Prayer,</hi> if he will?</p>
               <p>My ſelfe did know a very ancient <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great Preacher, whoſe <hi>Prayer,</hi> for a long tyme, was to ſay, with much humility, and ſimplicity, to Almighty God: <hi>O Lord, I am but a beaſt, and know not how to vſe Prayer, do thou teach it me, O Lord.</hi> With this he profited much, &amp; grew to haue moſt <hi>high Prayer;</hi> that of the Prophet,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.23</note> being accompliſhed in him, <hi>Vt iumentum factus ſum, &amp; ego ſemper tecum.</hi> Do you therfore humble your ſelues, &amp; become, in the ſight of, God, as if you were but poore beaſts, and our Lord wilbe with you. It doth much import in the ſight of God, that one do humble himſelfe; for great matters are negotiated, and obteyned in this manner, at the hands of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſty. And heere the Saints do note a thing of much importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; That as <hi>Humility</hi> is the meanes to obteyne <hi>Prayer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> ſo <hi>Prayer</hi> muſt be the meanes to obteyne <hi>Humility,</hi> and to go increaſing in it.</p>
               <p>And ſo they ſay, that when a man hath made good <hi>Prayer,</hi> he euer goes a

                  </note> that when a man parteth well contented from his <hi>Prayer,</hi> with I know not what kind of vaine complacence, &amp; a cloſe kind of eſtimation, and reputation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; conceiuing, forſooth, that he hath profitted much, and that already he is growing a kind of ſpirituall man, that Prayer deſerues to be ſuſpected. And therfore, if you ſay that you are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to draw many conſiderations out of <hi>Prayer,</hi> nor to haue any high <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations,</hi> let your courſe, be to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your ſelfe, and gather that <hi>Fruite</hi> from your <hi>Prayer,</hi> and you can haue no excuſe, for not doing that; &amp; euen that wilbe a very good Prayer.</p>
               <p>It is alſo a very good meanes, when a man is not able to enter <hi>Prayer,</hi> and that he is in conflict with many thoughts, and temptations, to do that which Father <hi>Auila</hi> doth thus aduiſe,<note place="margin">M.

               <p>And generally, let all men vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the principall care which the ſeruant of God ought to haue,<note place="margin">Note.</note> is to cleanſe and mortify his hart, and to keepe himſelfe free from all ſinne, and to be very firme and reſolute, not to

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:173307:98"/>that perhaps, it might do him hurt, by cutting his fingers. But the father takes the knife, and cuts the bread, that ſo the child may neither be put to any trouble, nor made ſubiect to any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. in this forte doth our Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. He giues you the bread, already cut; and will not giue you thoſe guſts, and conſolations, which are in that moſt high <hi>Prayer;</hi> becauſe perhaps, you would cut your ſelues; &amp; they would do you hurt, by making you wanton, and guiddy, and to hold your ſelues for ſpirituall perſons, and to prefer your ſelues before others. Our Lord doth you a greater fauour, in giuing you the <hi>bread</hi> already cut, then if he gaue you the <hi>knife,</hi> wherewith to cut it. If God, with your <hi>Prayer,</hi> giue you a great reſolution, and ſtrength, rather to dy, then to commit ſinne; and if he keepe you, through the whole courſe of your life, without committing a mortall ſinne, what better <hi>Prayer,</hi> and what better <hi>Fruite</hi> can you deſire, then this?</p>

If then our Lord, with this <hi>Prayer</hi> which you haue, do giue you this, of what can you complayne?

This is that <hi>Fruite</hi> which you were to gather out of <hi>Prayer,</hi> if it were neuer ſo high and ſublyme.

               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:173307:99"/>
               <p>Now this is that, which God doth worke in this playne, and ordinary Prayer.

And therfore we are to giue, for this, double thanks to our Lord. For, on the one ſide, he frees vs from the danger of vanity, and pride, which we might be ſubiect to; and on the other ſide, he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues vs that <hi>Fruite,</hi> and profit of Prayer, which is moſt complete.

               <p>We will neuer vnderſtand, as we ought, wherein Prayer, doth indeed conſiſt. Or to ſpeake more properly, we will neuer vnderſtand, as we ought, wherein our ſpirituall profit &amp; perfection doth conſiſt, which is the <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Fruite,</hi> to which our Prayer is
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:173307:100"/>ordeyned. And ſo, many tymes, when it goes ill with vs, we thinke it goes well; and when indeed it goeth well, we are apt to thinke, that it goeth ill. Drawe you, out of Prayer, that which we haue ſaid; and eſpecially to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed well that preſent day, and with edification,<note place="margin">

               <p>Henceforward therfore, do not complayne of <hi>Prayer,</hi> but turne your complaints againſt your ſelues, and ſay, <hi>It goes ill with me, in point of Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. It goes ill with me in point of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility;</hi>

               <p>THIS is wonte to be a very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary complaint, and therfore the <hi>Saints</hi> do generally treate therof, and eſpecially <hi>Caſsian.</hi>

                  </note> They ſay, that <hi>distraction in Prayer,</hi> may riſe from one of three cauſes. The firſt, our owne careleſſneſſe, or negligence; becauſe we go ſcattered in our owne thoghts,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and we ſet little guard vpon our hart; and make little recolection of our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. He who liueth in this manner, hath no reaſon to wonder, how he comes to be be <hi>diſtracted</hi> in <hi>Prayer,</hi> and why he can make no way in it. For it is cleere, that the <hi>images,</hi> and <hi>figures,</hi> and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:173307:101"/>
                  <hi>repreſentations</hi> of thoſe things which he ſuffers to enter in, are to diſquiet and moleſt him afterwards in <hi>Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Abbot <hi>Moyſes</hi> ſayth well,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Collat.</hi> 10.</note> 
                  <hi>That although it is not in the power of a man to keepe himſelfe from being ſurpriſed with thoughts, yet, that it is in his power, eyther not to admit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or els to driue them away.</hi> And he addeth further; <hi>that it is in great part in our power to correct and mend the quality of thoſe thoughts;</hi> and to cauſe that they may be holy, &amp; good, &amp; that thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which are impertinent, &amp; vayne, may grow by little &amp; little to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For if he giue himſelfe to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Exerciſes of <hi>Reading, Meditation,</hi> and <hi>Prayer;</hi> if he imploy himſelfe vpon good and holy workes, he wilbe ſure to haue good, and holy thoughts. But if, when he ſpends the day, he do but feed his ſenſes with vaine, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent things; his thoughts will not faile to be of the ſame quality.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe he bringeth a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, and it is alſo brought by Saint <hi>Anſelme,</hi> and S. <hi>Bernard.</hi>

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:173307:102"/>in the hand of the <hi>Miller,</hi> who rules it, to chooſe whether it ſhall <hi>grinde</hi> whea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, or oates, or any other graine; for that which they caſt before it, it will grinde. And ſo the hart of man, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without thinking vpon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, which it will grinde; but by your induſtry, and diligence, you may make it grind what corne you will, wheat, or rye, yea or earth it ſelfe; for in fine, whatſoeuer you caſt before it, that will it grinde. In conformity therfore of this, if you meane to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colected in <hi>Prayer,</hi> you muſt procure, as you conuerſe, to carry you hart recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and to keep the gates of your ſenſes cloſe.

               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:173307:103"/>
               <p>In the <hi>Pratum ſpirituale,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</note> it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of one of thoſe Fathers of the <hi>deſert,</hi> that riſing one night to Prayer, and ſinging of <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> as his cuſtome was, he heard the ſound of a trumpet, which was like the ſigne of giuing a battell. And the holy old man being troubled at it, and wondring from whence that noiſe might come, into ſo ſollitary a place, where there was no war, nor no ſouldiers; the Diuell appeared to him, and ſaid, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he thought that there was no battell towards, yet indeed there was; and that the trumpet ſhewed that the diuells were about to begin it, againſt the ſeruants of God; and that if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be free from it, he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to take his reſt, and if not, that he was to looke to himſelfe. But he, confiding in our Lord, did enter into his Prayer, and continued in it.</p>
               <p>One of the things wherby the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and great importance of Prayer may be particulerly well deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, is the watchfull and curſt eye which the diuell carrieth towards it; and the continuall warre, which he
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:173307:104"/>makes againſt it,<note place="margin">Nilus ca. <hi>44.</hi> &amp; <hi>47.</hi> de oratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, &amp; ca. <hi>100</hi> &amp; ſeqq. refer. aliqua Exempla circa hoc in biblio. Sacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum PP. Tom <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> as the holy <hi>Abbot Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> noteth very well. There be other good workes, which the diuell is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter content to paſſe withall, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. He will permit ſometymes, a <hi>fast,</hi> a <hi>diſcipline,</hi> and a <hi>hayrecloth,</hi> but a tyme of <hi>Prayer</hi> he cannot endure; but by all poſſible meanes, he procures to hinder it.</p>
               <p>From hence it growes, that when we are in Prayer, we ſuffer many ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes more temptations, then in any other action of ours. It ſeems that then, the whole troupe of thoughts ſet vpon vs, and ſometymes they are ſo filthy,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and ſo wicked, as if we went not ſo much thither to pray to God, as to be moleſted and vexed, with all kinde of temptations by the Diuell. For things which before did neuer preſent themſelues to vs, nor neuer paſſed by our thoughts, in our whole life, do offer themſelues to vs in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; as if they kept themſelues of purpoſe for vs, againſt that tyme. And ſince the Diuell knowes, that Prayer is the redreſſe of all our miſeryes, and the beginning, and fountaine of all our
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:173307:104"/>ſpirituall good, and an efficacious meanes for the obteyning of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, it puts him to much payne, and he imployeth all the power he hath to hinder it. And ſo the Saints are wont to call Prayer, <hi>Tormentum Daemon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This very thing ought to be a cauſe, and motiue to vs, to make vs more to eſteeme, and more diligently to frequent the vſe of Prayer: and ſo much the more, becauſe the Diuell, out of a meere enuy which he beares vs, ſeekes to hinder vs. <hi>S. Thomas</hi> of <hi>Auila</hi> and other graue Authors affirme,<note place="margin">Thomas Abulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</note> that for this very reaſon, our Holy Mother the <hi>Church</hi> who is gouerned by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and knoweth well, that the cuſtome of our enemy, is to tempt,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and make all the war he can vpon them who are in Prayer; hath ordeyned, that at the beginning of euery one of her Canonicall howers, this verſe be ſaid: <hi>Deus in adiutorium meum intende:<note place="margin">

               <p>Againe, it wilbe of much helpe, if preſently when we awake, we giue no place to other thoughts, but thinke of the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> which we are to make; preparing our ſelues for Prayer, by ſome conſideration, accommodated to that which we are to <hi>meditate. Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian, S. Bonauenture,</hi> and <hi>S. Iohn Climacus,</hi> do hold this, for a very important ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe. And they ſay, that the order of our Prayer, and conſequently the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the whole day after, doth much depend heerupon. And <hi>S.

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:173307:110"/>is of much importance; he is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very diligent, and ſollicitous, in watching, when we chance to wake; to the end, that inſtantly he may take vp his lodging with vs; and ſo, gather the firſt fruits of the whole day. And he ſayth, that there is amongſt thoſe maligne ſpirits, one, whome they call the <hi>Precurſor,</hi> who hath the office to watch, and ſet vpon vs by night, at the tyme when we firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, out of our ſleep, yea and a little before we are fully awake, when a man is ſcarce returned entirely vnto himſelfe; that ſo he may repreſent cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine deformed filthy things to our mind, or at leaſt, things impertinent; therby taking the poſſeſſion for the whole day; for he conceiues, that the hart wilbe his, who is firſt poſſeſſed therof.</p>
               <p>For this reaſon, it will import vs much, that we be full of caution, in giuing no place to our enemy, but that inſtantly, when euen we haue ſcarce opened our eyes, the memory of our Lord, may be already planted in our harts, before any other thought be

And our <hi>B.

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:173307:114"/>ſometimes proceed from a naturall cauſe, as by want of ſleepe, much wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynes, ill weather, exceſſe of age, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of eating, or of drinking, althogh it ſhould be but of water. Thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient holy Fathers of the <hi>Deſert,</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, how God ſhewed to them in ſpirit, that there were certaine <hi>Diuells,</hi> who did ſet themſelues vpon the necks, and heads of <hi>Monkes,</hi> and made them ſleepe. And others who put cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſingers into their mouthes, and made them yawne. At other tymes, this groweth from our ſloath, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence, when a man is in Prayer, in ſome ſuch compoſition of his perſon, as may giue occaſion to <hi>Sleepe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 22.</note> The chiefe remedy for this, is that which was ſaid before, concerning attention; and to remember that we are in the <hi>preſence</hi> of Almighty God. And, as a man who is in the preſence of ſome great Prince, will not preſume to ſleepe; ſo we, who conſider that we ſtand before the maieſty of God, and that he is beholding vs, ought to be much confounded in ourſelues, when we ſleepe in <hi>Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:173307:114"/>
               <p>It is alſo a good remedy to ſtand on foote, without leaning; and to waſh our eyes with cold water; and ſome vſe to carry a wet napkin about them, if they be much oppreſſed with this temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Some help themſelues, by looking vp to heauen; and by making Prayer, where there is much light; or els to pray in preſence of the B. <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in company of others; or to take a diſcipline before Prayer, wherby they may remaine, both awake, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout. Others, whilſt they are <hi>Praying,</hi> giue themſelues ſome kinde of little payne, whereby they keepe themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues awake; &amp; when they pray alone, they ſpread their armes, into the forme of a <hi>Croſſe.</hi> It helpeth alſo for this, to ſpeake, and ſay ſome <hi>Vocall Prayers,</hi> wherby a man may be ſtirred vp and much reuiued, as we ſaid before. It is good to ſerue our ſelues of theſe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 22.</note> and ſuch other remedyes, beſeeching our Lord, that he will cure this infirmity of ours.</p>

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:173307:115"/>tymes in <hi>Prayer,</hi>) that there appeared to him Chriſt our Lord, being cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, with his back turned towards him; and then he ſaid, <hi>Why art thou ſo negligent and ſlothfull? Thou doeſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to ſee my face.</hi> Of another he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth there,<note place="margin">Caeſarius lib. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>18.</hi>
                  </note> that God did giue him a more ſharp reproofe, becauſe being in the <hi>Quire</hi> at <hi>Prayer,</hi> and ſleeping as he vſed, a <hi>crucifix</hi> came to him from the <hi>Altar,</hi> and gaue him ſuch a blow vpon the cheeke, that he dyed of it the third day after. All this, giues vs well to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, how much this negligence and tepidity dipleaſeth God. The te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, and negligent <hi>Religious man</hi> (as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarius</hi> ſayth) doth prouoke God,<note place="margin">

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:173307:115"/>the little reuerence wherewith he had remained, in the preſence of our Lord, whome he was to receiue.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXV.</hi> How much it importeth vs to take ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary tyme, for the giuing of our ſelues to <hi>Prayer.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS the men of this world, beſides the ordinary, and daily refection of their bodyes, haue their extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Feaſts, and banquets, wherein they exceed their common courſe; ſo alſo is it very ſit, that beſides our day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Prayer,</hi> we ſhould alſo haue our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall feaſts, and banquets; where our ſoules may not eate by ſo ſtrict mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as at other tymes; but may be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the abundance, and ſweetnes of the grace of our Lord. Nature it ſelfe teacheth this. For we ſee, that the ground is not content, with the dew which falleth, night by night; but it requires ſometymes, that it ſhould rayne a whole weeke, or two, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing; and all is little inough, to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:173307:116"/>the end, that it may remaine ſo well imbrued, with water, as that the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>Winde,</hi> and <hi>Sunne</hi> may not dry it vp. So alſo it is fit for our ſoules, that, beſides the ordinary dew of euery day, they may haue ſome ſet tymes, wherein they may procure to fill themſelues ſo well with vertue, and with the very iuyce of deuotion, as that the <hi>Sun,</hi> or <hi>Winde</hi> of future buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and temptations, or the other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of the world, may not ſerue to dry them vp.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, for ſome tyme, in retired places; ſo to giue themſelues the more to <hi>Prayer,</hi> and diuine <hi>Contemplation.</hi> We read of the holy <hi>Abbot Arſenius,</hi> that he had for a cuſtome, to take ſome day in the weeke, for this purpoſe, which was the <hi>Saturday;</hi> at which tyme he continued from the euening therof, till the next day morning, in <hi>Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is very important, not only for the aduancing,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and improuing our ſelues more in vertue, and perfection,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:173307:116"/>but euen for the not returning back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. For ſo great is the weakenes &amp; miſery of man, and the inclination which we haue to ill; that although ſometymes we begin our <hi>ſpirituall Exerciſes</hi> with feruout, yet we inſtantly go decaying, by little and little, and vnſaying that, which we profeſſed before. Like water, which how high ſoeuer it boile, yet by retiring it from the ſire, it doth preſently, by little and little, returne to the naturall coldenes. So do we returne inſtantly to our te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and ſlackneſſe; which we ſeeme to haue more rooted in vs, and more connaturall to vs, then water hath to coldenes. <hi>Senſus enim, &amp; cogitatio humani cordis, in malum prona ſunt,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To this may be added, that ſince we are ſo full of imployments, ſome of vs in <hi>ſtudies,</hi> others in particuler <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteries,</hi> others in <hi>Offices</hi> and <hi>exterior bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe;</hi> we haue ſo much the more need, of this particuler kind of <hi>Recollection.</hi>

                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:173307:117"/>For although our buſineſſe be good, and holy; yet as the knife is dulled by being dayly vſed, and, from tyme to tyme, it is neceſſary to giue it a new edge; ſo we grow dayly dull, and be forgetting our owne ſpirituall profit, whilſt we ſet forward, that of others. Euen the Philoſophers could tell vs, that, <hi>Omne agens, agendo repatitur. Euery agent, doth euen by doing, ſuffer,</hi> and part with ſomewhat of his owne; &amp; euery man findes this by experience in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. It doth therfore importe vs very much, to recollect our ſelues at certay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne tymes, and to vntye our mindes from all other imployments; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe this loſſe, and to repaire that, which is decaying dayly in vs, and to recouer new forces for the future. For we are yet more obliged, to helpe our ſelues then our neighbours,<note place="margin">3. <hi>p. tract. c.</hi> 4.1.8.</note> and <hi>Charity well ordered beginnes at home.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is alſo to be done, with great care, ſince it importeth ſo much, euen for the very <hi>End,</hi> of helping our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. For a moſt certayne thing it is,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that from our owne greater ſpirituall profit, doth alſo grow the greater ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:173307:117"/>profit of our neighbours. And therfore, that tyme is not loſt to them, which any man takes for himſelfe; but rather they ſhall grow rich, by it. It is like the letting of land lye fallow for this yeare, to the end that it may fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy ſo much the more, the next. Father <hi>Auila</hi> ſaid, that it was like the moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a ſtone,<note place="margin">M. Auila.</note> to the end that it may be made able to <hi>grind.</hi> And ſo a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to much in buſines, is ſo far from being any reaſon, why he ſhould not recolect himſelfe, as that for the ſame very cauſe, and ſo much the more, as a man is imploied, &amp; much imbarked in <hi>ministeryes,</hi> and <hi>buſineſses,</hi> in ſo much the more neceſſity he is, of reſorting to this remedy. They who go ſayling far by ſea, haue need to take <hi>Porte</hi> many ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, to refreſh themſelues, and take in neceſſary, &amp; new prouiſions. And ſo they, who go imbarked in <hi>buſineſſe,</hi> &amp; <hi>ministeries,</hi> and <hi>imployments</hi> with their neighbours, and who are in ſo many dangers, and occaſions of ſinne; haue need many tymes, to make recourſe to to the <hi>Port</hi> of ſolitude and recolection, that ſo they may take in new &amp; neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:173307:118"/>prouiſions; and dreſſe vp, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide themſelues, of what is ſit.</p>
               <p>In the holy Goſpell, we haue an excellent example of this. The <hi>Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt S. Marke,</hi> recounteth how the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles went full of buſineſſe, in the imployments which they had, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their neighbours; in ſuch ſort as that they had ſcarce tyme to eate, ſo great was the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of people which was offered to them. They went to giue account, to Chriſt our Lord, of that which paſſed heerin; and he ſaid to them, <hi>Come a part into the deſert, and repoſe awhile?</hi> Recollect your ſelues a while, in the ſolitude of the <hi>deſert.</hi> If then the Apoſtles had need of repoſe, and recolection, and that our <hi>B. Sauiour</hi> himſelfe did counſell it to them, how much more need therof haue we?</p>
               <p>They who treat of <hi>Prayer,</hi> ſay very well, that <hi>Prayer is that to the ſoule, which repoſe and ſleepe is to the body.</hi> And ſo, the <hi>holy ſcripture</hi> calleth it <hi>ſleepe:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Ego dormio, &amp; cor meum vigilat. Adiuro vos filiae Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.4.</note> 
                  <hi>ne ſuſcitetis, neque euigilare faciatis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectam, donec ipſa velit.</hi> And declaring this more at large, they ſay, of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:173307:118"/>that when it repoſeth by corporall ſleepe, it reſteth and recouereth new force and ſtrength, and ſo the ſoule, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing in the ſleepe of <hi>Prayer,</hi> recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth alſo freſh breath, and life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to labour,<note place="margin">Note.</note> in the ſeruice of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. And more then this. As a man who feedeth vpon good meat, yet if he want repoſe, and neceſſary ſleepe, will prooue but weake &amp; ſicke, yea and alſo be in danger, to looſe his wits; ſo alſo he, who ſhall go greatly imployed in exterior buſineſſes (how holy &amp; good ſoeuer they may be) yet if he want the neceſſary repoſe, &amp; reſt of <hi>Prayer,</hi> he will prooue but weake &amp; decaied in ſpirit, and will runne ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard to looſe himſelfe. And therfore doth the <hi>Spouſe</hi> require, <hi>That they awake not his beloued, till she will, herſelfe.</hi> When they wake a man out of ſleepe, by any noiſe which they make, it is a thinge diſpleaſing to him; but when he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of himſelfe, becauſe nature is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed, and for that he hath repoſed inough, (in regard that the fumes which mounted vp to the braine, are now diſgeſted,) there is no offence
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:173307:119"/>therein. Iuſt ſo is it with the ſoule. Our Lord requireth, that no man, nor no thing trouble it, nor hinder the <hi>Prayer</hi> which ſhe is in; but when that reſt is taken which is neceſſary, ſhe may then awake herſelfe, and returne to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of the works of <hi>Charity,</hi> and ſo they wilbe well performed.</p>
               <p>Although it be of great importance for all men, and vpon all iuſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to recollect themſelues in <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Exerciſes,</hi> and to giue themſelues more to <hi>Prayer,</hi> and ſo much the more as we ſhall do it, ſo much the better it wilbe; yet particulerly in ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and coniunction of reaſons, this is neceſſary. As namely, when a man ſees,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that he goes declyning in the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Exerciſes</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> of <hi>Examen,</hi> of <hi>ſpirituall reading,</hi> and that now, he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth not the fruite, and profit by it, which were fit: When he ſeeth that he growes negligent, and careleſſe in the obſeruance of his <hi>Rules,</hi> and that now, he makes no more accounte of ſmall matters: When he ſeemes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that he is not ſpirituall, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerted, but that he is very exterior,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:173307:119"/>and much carried away, by the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and buſineſſes which he treates: When he alſo obſerueth, that he doth not ouercome, and mortify himſelfe out right, in ſome one thing; it is very good for him to recollect himſelfe, ſome dayes, in theſe <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> that ſo he may finiſh the reſolution, to conquer himſelfe. For it may be, that in one of theſe <hi>Recollections,</hi> he may obteyne more grace of our Lord, and more ſtrength wherewith to mortify, and ouercome himſelfe, then by the labour of many dayes.</p>
               <p>Many tymes it happeneth, that a man goes lymping; he riſeth, and he falleth, and in ſome one of theſe <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,</hi> he remaineth vnbeguiled of the vanity of the world, and fully poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of <hi>Truth,</hi> and reſolute to do all that is fit. He changeth his ſtyle, &amp; he takes a new manner of life vpon him. For in fine, the being ſo long alone, treating with God, and with himſelfe, is a great diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to make our Lord ſpeake to his hart, and to induce his Maieſty to do many fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Againe, after the hauing ended ſome very long iourney, or ſome bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, or imployment of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſtraction; this kind of <hi>Recollection,</hi> ſeemeth to be as important, as good &amp; dainty treaty, is to a body, after a long diſeaſe, to the end that a man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer himſelfe, &amp; repaire the ſtrength which he hath loſt. And for the ſame reaſon, it is alſo very good, for a man to prepare himſelfe before hand, by theſe <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> when he findes that he is growing into ſome ſuch kind of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; to the end that he may do things with more vertue, and leſſe ſpirituall
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:173307:120"/>loſſe of his owne. The <hi>Preſeruatiue,</hi> is a better kinde of <hi>Phiſicke,</hi> then the <hi>Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> which comes after the <hi>diſeaſe.</hi> And therefore <hi>our B.

The ſame is alſo good, when one is to go into ſome long <hi>Miſsion.</hi> Wherof Chriſt our Lord gaue vs an example.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 4.1.</note> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he began to preach, he retired himſelfe <hi>fourty days, into Deſert.</hi> Alſo in a tyme of tribulations, and afflictions, whether they be generall of the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le <hi>Church,</hi> or of his owne <hi>Order,</hi> or of his owne perſon, the occaſion is very good, for this. For to add more <hi>Prayer,</hi> and more <hi>pennance,</hi> and mortification, hath euer beene a meanes, much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented in the <hi>Church,</hi> for appeaſing the wrath of God, and obteyning mercy from him.</p>
               <p>All theſe are very good occaſions to make a man recolect himſelfe in theſe <hi>Exerciſes.</hi> But indeed we haue no need, to ſtand ſeeking of occaſions. Our owne neceſſity, and intereſt, muſt ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite vs to deſire, and procure this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:173307:121"/>very often. At leaſt, no yeare ought to paſſe, without our meeting with theſe <hi>ſpirituall Vacations.</hi> And when we do it, it muſt be very much in earneſt, and with the whole hart. For a thing of ſo great ſubſtance, as this, muſt in no caſe be performed with ceremony, nor for complement, or becauſe it is handſome.</p>
               <p>Our Lord hath imparted this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to the <hi>Society,</hi> in a very particuler manner, not only for our owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, but for the help, and profit of our neighbour.

This he repeateth
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:173307:124"/>many tymes, as one who well knew, the much good that growes therby. And not only in the <hi>ſpirituall Exerciſes</hi> themſelues, which is the principall, &amp; which muſt giue force, and ſpirit to all the reſt; but for all his other exteriour miniſteryes, and imployments, a man is to goe, a very good proficient, out of the <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> fetching breath from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, wherewith to do his duty, and to keepe his <hi>Rules,</hi> better then before. So that the Fruite of his <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> is not to be gathered, for that tyme alone, but principally for the future. And ſo as that when any man comes forth of the <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> another man may ſee, the profit which he hath made, by the actions which he performeth.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which we are to procure, to draw out of theſe <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> is, to ouercome and mortifie our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, in any vntowardnes, or imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to which he may haue beene ſubiect. Let euery man caſt his eyes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon thoſe things, in which he vſeth to ſayle moſt frequently; or to be a cauſe to make others fayle, or be ſcandalized by the diſedification which he giueth
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:173307:124"/>them. And let him procure to go out of the <hi>Exerciſes</hi> very well, and for that they were principally ordeyned, &amp; it is theyr <hi>End.</hi> And ſo, the <hi>Title</hi> which our <hi>B.

               <p>And it is alſo to be aduertiſed, that when a man recollects himſelfe,<note place="margin">Note.</note> to make the <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> he muſt not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to himſelfe, the obteyning of <hi>very high Prayer;</hi> nor to thinke, by that retiring, and ſhutting vp himſelfe, that he muſt preſently haue much quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; attention, and familiarity with almighty God; for it may well hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that he ſhall be ſubiect to more <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions,</hi> vnquietnes, and temptations, then when he was in the diſpatch of his <hi>buſineſſe,</hi> and performing his <hi>office</hi> abroad. But he is to fix his minde, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon fetching that which I haue ſaid, out of his <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> and to reſolue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vpon that, in great earneſt. And
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:173307:128"/>if he obteyne this, he ſhall haue made the <hi>Exerciſes</hi> very well, though he had not the deuotion, which he deſired. Whereas if he obteyne not this, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, from the very firſt hower he haue beene euer diſſoluing himſelfe in tears, and deuotion, he ſhall not haue made the Exerciſes well; for in fine, that was not the end therof,</p>
               <p>That other aduertiſement will alſo help vs much, which our <hi>B. Father</hi> gaue, and which he will euer haue vs obſerue in <hi>Prayer.</hi> That afterward, when a man hath ended his hower <hi>of Prayer,</hi> he ſhall,<note place="margin">Ignatius l.

If ill,<note place="margin">Note.</note> he ſhall conſider the cauſe from whence that may haue procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. He ſhall conſider, if he prepared his <hi>Exerciſe</hi> well; if he gaue place to any impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thoughts; if he ſuffred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be ouercome with ſleepe; if he deteyned himſelfe too much in the ſpeculation of his <hi>Vnderſtanding.</hi> If his hart were remiſſe, and fainte; and if
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:173307:129"/>he did not procure, to exerciſe the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his <hi>Will.</hi> If he had not an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as pure as he ought to haue had it; but that he ſought his owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, more then the accompliſhment of the diuine will. If he finde himſelfe to haue ſailed, in any of theſe things, he ſhall repent himſelfe therof, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe amendment, for the tyme to come. And if it haue prooued well, with him, he ſhall giue thanks to our Lord God, procuring to carry himſelfe after the ſame manner, at his other ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of <hi>Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This document, is of much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: Firſt, becauſe by this <hi>Examen,</hi> &amp; <hi>Reflection,</hi> which is made, how the <hi>Prayer</hi> hath proued, experience is taken to auoide the faults, and to proſecute that, which was well done; wherby a man obteynes a certaine ſpirituall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and magiſtery, which groweth from experimentall knowledge. For this reaſon, did our <hi>B. Father,</hi> eſteeme greatly of this <hi>Examen,</hi> and <hi>Reflection,</hi> for the making of ſuch, as might be <hi>Maisters,</hi> not only in this, but alſo in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imployments, and miniſteries of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:173307:129"/>outs. And ſo,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>4.</hi> p. Conſt. c. <hi>8.</hi> litera D.</note> in the fourth part of his <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> he ſayth: That it will greatly helpe a <hi>Ghoſtely Father,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the doing of his duty well, to make <hi>reflection,</hi> and to conſider if he haue made any fault, in the hearing of <hi>Confeſsions.</hi> Eſpecially (ſayth he) let him do it, in his beginnings, ſo to helpe himſelfe another tyme; and to drawe amendeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out of his errours. For this reaſon therfore, the <hi>Examen of Prayer,</hi> is to be made. And this is the firſt thing which we are do therein. And <hi>Prayer</hi> is of ſo great eſtimation, and it importeth vs ſo much that we be accuſtomed to make it well, and to go ſhredding off the faults which we make therein; that our <hi>B. Father,</hi> did not content himſelfe with the <hi>Examen</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which we vſe to make eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day at <hi>noone,</hi> &amp; at <hi>night;</hi> but inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alſo, aſſoone as we haue ended our <hi>Prayer,</hi> his expreſſe pleaſure is, that we ſhold make a particuler <hi>Examen</hi> therof.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing, (and that a very principall one) is, that a man is to conſider the <hi>Fruite,</hi> which he hath gathered by that <hi>Prayer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> and to returne
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:173307:130"/>to actuate agayne vpon it, (as when one repeats his leſſon) and drawes out the <hi>Concluſions,</hi> and <hi>Truthes,</hi> which haue occurred; and makes as it were, an <hi>epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> of them. And this <hi>Examen,</hi> is to be held, for a thing of ſo great importan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, that if a man want tyme to make it after the <hi>Prayer</hi> is ended, he is to make it in the very <hi>Prayer,</hi> it ſelfe, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding therof.</p>
               <p>We may add in this place, another pointe which will alſo be of good vſe. That a man ſet downe, that which he hath wrought out of his <hi>Prayer;</hi> writing the <hi>deſires</hi> which he hath had, and the <hi>Purpoſes</hi> which he hath made; but this, muſt not be done at large, but in a briefe manner. And ſo alſo, let him ſet downe, ſuch <hi>Truthes,</hi> and <hi>Illustrations,</hi> or <hi>Vubeguilings</hi> of the vanity of this world, as our Lord is wont to giue in <hi>Prayer.</hi> Sometymes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning ſome <hi>Vertue,</hi> and at other tymes, concerning the <hi>Myſteryes</hi> themſelues, which are in queſtion.

And when he findeth afterward, that he arriueth not to the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> of that he was before; he is confounded, to ſee, that he is no more the man he was; and that, inſteed of aduancing, he is retired. Wherby he will eyther animate himſelfe to put on a pace; or els he will ſupply, by his confuſion, that which he ſhall want of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:173307:131"/>perfection. So that this, vſeth euer to be of much profit; though eſpecially it be ſo, in tyme of the <hi>Exerciſes.</hi>

But yet, the ſame muſt be done, to ſome proportion, in this <hi>ſpirituall Reading;</hi> &amp; ſo the <hi>Saints</hi> do aduiſe. And they ſay, that <hi>ſpirituall Reading,</hi> muſt be like the drinking of a Hen, which drinkes by little, and little, and ſo lifteth vp the head agayne.</p>
               <p>Heerby a man may ſee, what a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, &amp; Companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Reading</hi> is to <hi>Prayer.</hi> It is ſo, in ſo great degree, that when we apply any man firſt to <hi>Mentall Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and that, we will proceed with him gently (by degrees) to put him into ſome diſpoſition that way; we aduiſe him <hi>to read ſome ſpirituall booke,</hi> &amp; whilſt he is <hi>Reading,</hi> to make ſome ſtations &amp; pawſes, in ſuch ſort as we haue ſaid; for by this meanes, our Lord is wont, many times, to raiſe men, to the <hi>Exerciſe
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:173307:135"/>of Mentall Prayer.</hi> And ſo alſo, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men are not able to enter wel vpon <hi>Prayer,</hi> and if they thinke they ſhall not be able to go through with it, at that tyme; we vſe to counſell them, to take ſome good booke in hand, &amp; to ioyne <hi>Prayer,</hi> &amp; <hi>Reading</hi> both together. Firſt, <hi>Reading</hi> a little, &amp; then <hi>Meditating,</hi> and <hi>Praying</hi> vpon it; and then to <hi>Read</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther little. For by this meanes, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding being tyed vp by the words, which are read, a man is much more ſecured from ſcattering himſelfe vpon diuers imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; thoughts, then when he was free, and looſe.

               <p>For this it is,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that the <hi>Saints</hi> do ſo earneſtly recommend <hi>ſpirituall Reading,</hi> &amp; they deliuer in effect, the ſame prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp; profits as belonging to it, which they aſcribe to <hi>Priaer.</hi> For they ſay, <hi>That it is the ſpirituall foode of the ſoule; That it makes vs strong &amp; ſtiſſe againſt temptations; That it breeds in vs,</hi>

               <p>Sometymes you may go, and haue a tyme of conuerſation with <hi>S. Bernard,</hi> another with <hi>S. Gregory</hi> another with <hi>S.

                  <note place="margin">Hieron. epiſt. ad Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam.</note> is ſo very great, that <hi>S.

                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:173307:139"/>which conteyneth much doctrine. That <hi>Saynt</hi> recounts, how a certaine <hi>Cauallier,</hi> an <hi>Affrican,</hi> called <hi>Potitianus,</hi> comming one day to viſite him, gaue him newes of the wonderfull things, which the world was ſaying of <hi>S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony.</hi> And he added further, that one euening, while the was at <hi>Treuers,</hi> (imployed, vpon ſeing certayne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique ſports, which were repreſented there) himſelfe with three other <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,</hi> friends of his, went out to take the aire. And that two, of the fower, did chance vpon the <hi>Cell</hi> of a certaine <hi>Monke;</hi> and finding there a booke, wherein the Life of <hi>S. Anthony</hi> was written, one of them began to read it, and inſtantly his hart was kindled with a holy kinde of loue. And being all angry with himſelfe, he ſaid thus to his friend. <hi>Tell me I beſeech thee, what is that which we pretend to obteyne, with all the paines we take? What is that, which we ayme at? In the hope of what, do we thus earneſtly imploy our ſelues? Can we perhaps, haue a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher ambition in the Court, then to be Fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of the Emperor? And yet euen in that fortune, what is there, which is not top full of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:173307:140"/>danger? And by how many dangers, do we still proceed towards ſome greater danger? And how long shall we ſweat in this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite? But to be the friend and ſauourite of God himſefe, behold I am made ſo, if I will, euen at this very inſtant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This he ſaid, and being growne bigge, and ſwolne, with the feruent deſire of bringing forth a new life, he reſtored his eyes to the booke, and read on, and was inwardly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and his mind was wholy diſpoſseſſed of worldely cares, as immediately afterwards appeared. For whilſt he was Reading, and rowling vp and downe, thoſe waues of his vnquiet hart, he would ſometymes groane deepely, and then agayne pawſe a while. And reſoluing at laſt, vpon a better courſe, he ſaid with a ſerene countenance, to his friend: Euen now haue I broken looſe, from thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes wherby hitherto we haue beene ſeized. I haue firmely reſolued, to be the ſeruant of God, and I will ſet vpon it, in this place, and at this very instant. As for thee, if thou canst not be content, to imitate me, at leaſt diſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wade me not. But the other anſwered, that he would gladly ioyne himſelfe to him, as a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion in the proſecuting of ſo honourable a war, &amp; the obteyning of ſo noble a pay. And
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:173307:140"/>both of them, did build vp that Spirituall Tower, with the treaſure which is only able to do it, of forſaking all things, and following Chriſt our Lord.</hi> And that which is as ſtrange, <hi>they both had Spouſes, who, as ſoone as they knew what theſe men had reſolued, did conſecrate themſelues to God, by a vow of Chaſtity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This doth <hi>S. Augustine</hi> relate; and this Example was of ſo great effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, with himſelfe, that ſoone after, he thus cryed out, with great exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to another friend of his, <hi>What is this which we indure? What is this? What haue we heard?</hi> Surgunt indocti, &amp; cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum rapiunt, &amp; nos cum doctrinis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris, ſine corde ecce vbi volutamur in carne &amp; ſanguine: <hi>The vnlearned men of the world, teare heauen from betweene our hands, and we, with our great knowledge, and learning, behold how without braynes, or courage, we are contented still to wallow, in flesh and blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But with this alteration, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the Saint relates, <hi>how he entred into a Garden, there adioyning, and did ſpread himſelfe, at the foote of a certaine figtree; and (letting looſe the reynes to teares)

So that, as our Lord God created vs, to be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in his preſence, &amp; to enioy him in heauen; ſo was it alſo his pleaſure, that, here on earth, we ſhould haue an image, &amp; modell of that bleſſedneſſe, by walking euer in his ſight, reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and beholding him,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12.</note> though in obſcure manner. <hi>Videmus nunc per ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum

                  <hi>I ſought that without me, O Lord, which yet was within me.</hi> Within you is God; and more <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> and more intrinſecally, &amp; more intimately is God in me, then my ſelfe. <hi>In him we liue, and moue, and haue our being.</hi> He it is, who giueth <hi>Life,</hi> to all that which <hi>liues;</hi> and he, who giueth <hi>ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth</hi> to all which hath any <hi>ſtrength;</hi> and he who giues <hi>being,</hi> to all that which <hi>is.</hi> And if he were not <hi>preſent,</hi> ſuſteyning all things, they all would leaue to be, and returne to their <hi>nothing.</hi> Conſider therfore, that thou art all, full of God; inuironed &amp; compaſſed in with God, and as it were ſwimming in God. <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni ſuunt caeli &amp; terra gloria tua,</hi> are very good wordes to this purpoſe: <hi>The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, and the earth, are full of thy glory.</hi>

               <p>Some, to help themſelues, more in this,<note place="margin">Note.</note> do conſider all the world to be full of God, as indeed it is; and they imagine themſelues, to be in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of this infinite <hi>ſea of God;</hi> circled, &amp;

               <p>But now, this other <hi>Preſence of God,</hi> wherof we treate, excludes all theſe

               <p>Secondly, the humanity of Chriſt our Lord, may be fancied, and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the <hi>imagination,</hi> becauſe he hath a body, and a figure; but God, as God, cannot be <hi>imagined,</hi> or figured, as he is, becauſe he hath no <hi>body,</hi> nor <hi>figure,</hi> but is <hi>a pure ſpirit.</hi> Nay we cannot ſo much as imagine an <hi>Angell,</hi> no nor <hi>our owne ſoule,</hi> as indeed it is, becauſe it is a <hi>ſpirit;</hi>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:173307:152"/>and how much leſſe then, ſhall we be able to imagine, or frame a conceit of, how God is.</p>
               <p>But how then, are we to conſider, that God as God, is ſtill <hi>preſent</hi> with vs? I ſay there is no more to be done, but only to produce an act of <hi>Fayth,</hi> ſuppoſing already, that God is <hi>preſent</hi> there; ſince our <hi>Fayth</hi> tells vs ſo, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out labouring to know how, or in what faſhion that is; as <hi>S. Paul</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, that <hi>Moyſes</hi> did. <hi>Qui inuiſibilem, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam videns, ſuſtinuit. He conſidered God, who is inuiſible, and had him preſent still, as if he had ſeene him.</hi> But yet ſo, as that he would not ſtriue to know,<note place="margin">Note.</note> or <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,</hi> how that was; but, as when a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ſpeaking with ſome friend of his, by night, without reflecting how that is, and not conſidering it; but only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing, and delighting in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation and preſence of his friend, who he knowes is preſent, with him there. In this ſort, are we to conſider God <hi>preſent</hi> with vs. It is inough that we know, our frend is there, that we may enioy him. Do not dwell vpon thinking, how that is. You will not
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:173307:153"/>light vpon it; for it is yet, by night, for vs. Do but ſtay till it be light, and when the morning of the other life appeares; he will then be diſcouered, and we ſhalbe able <hi>to ſee him cleerely, as he is. Cùm apparauerit, ſimiles ei crimus, quoniam videbimus eum ſicutieſt.</hi> For this, did God appeare to <hi>Moyſes,</hi> in obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in a cloud; that you may not looke to <hi>ſee</hi> him, but only <hi>belieue</hi> him to be preſent.</p>
               <p>All this which we haue ſaide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the firſt act of <hi>Vnderſtanding,</hi> which muſt be preſuppoſed. But it muſt be conſidered alſo heere, that the chiefe part of this <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> doth not conſiſt in this. For not only is the <hi>Vnderſtanding</hi> to imploy it ſelfe, in behoulding God <hi>preſent;</hi> but a man muſt alſo imploy the <hi>Will;</hi> by aſpiring to God, and by louing him, and by vniting himſelfe to him. And in theſe acts of the <hi>Will,</hi> this <hi>Exerciſe</hi> doth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally conſiſt, whereof we ſhall treate, in the next Chapter.</p>

               <p>SAINT <hi>Bonauenture,</hi> in his <hi>Myſticall Theology</hi> ſayth, that the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Will,</hi> wherewith we muſt lift vp our ſelues to God, in this holy <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> are certayne ardent deſires of the hart, wherby the ſoule doth thirſt, to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited with God, in <hi>perfect loue.</hi> Certay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne <hi>inflamed affections,</hi> they are; certayne <hi>ſighes,</hi> which breake out of the very bowells of the ſoule, wherewith it cals vpon God. Certayne <hi>pious, and amorous ſpringings of the will,</hi> wherewith,<note place="margin">Note.</note> as with certayne <hi>ſpirituall wings,</hi> ſhe reacheth, &amp; ſtretcheth her ſelfe vpward; and goes approaching, and vniting herſelfe, more and more, with God. Theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, theſe vehement, and enflamed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the hart, the Saints do call <hi>Aſpirations.</hi> Becauſe by them, the ſoule raiſeth herſelfe vp to God, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyeth the ſame, with <hi>aſpiring</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:173307:154"/>him. <hi>S. Bonauenture</hi> alſo ſayth, they are therfore called <hi>Aſpirations,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as by reſpiring we do, without deliberation, draw our breath, &amp; that interior aire of our body; ſo do we alſo with great agility, and ſometymes without any deliberation at all, (or in effect without any) drawe out theſe inflamed deſires, from the moſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall part of our ſoule.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Aſpirations,</hi> and deſires, a man declares by certayne <hi>Prayers,</hi> which are ſhort, and frequent, and they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>iaculatory, Raptim iaculatas,</hi> ſayth <hi>S.

Thoſe old <hi>Monkes,</hi> according to the relation of <hi>Caſsian,</hi> did much vſe theſe <hi>Prayers. Breues quidem, ſed creberrimae.</hi> And they eſteemed, and made great account therof: Partely, becauſe they were ſhort, and did not weary the brayne; and partly, becauſe they were made with feruour, and with an erected ſpirit, and at an inſtant they are ſent into the <hi>high Preſence of Almighty God,</hi> in ſuch ſort, as that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell

                  </note> that makes them; nor to caſt any impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into his hart. <hi>S.

               <p>This way, of going in the <hi>Preſence of God,</hi> is (generally ſpeaking) more ſit for vs, more eaſy, and more profitable. It will therfore be neceſſary, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in declaring the vſe, and practiſe of this <hi>Exerciſe.

               <p>Now foraſmuch, as in ſpirituall lif, there are three wayes, <hi>The Purgatiue way,</hi> which belongeth to <hi>beginners;</hi> the <hi>Illuminatiue way,</hi> which belongeth to ſuch as are <hi>Proficient;</hi> &amp; the <hi>Vnitiue way,</hi> which belongeth to ſuch as are in ſome degree of <hi>perfection;</hi> there are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall directours, who aſſigne three kinds of <hi>Aſpirations,</hi> or <hi>Iaculatory Prayers.</hi> Some, which are addreſſed towards the obteyning of pardon for ſinne, and towards the purging of the ſoule from
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:173307:156"/>vice, and terrene affections, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Purgatiue way.</hi> Others, which are addreſſed towards the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning of <hi>vertues,</hi> and ouercomming temptations, and vndertaking of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultyes, and troubles, for the exerciſe of piety; which belong to the <hi>Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiue way.</hi> And others, which addreſſe vs,<note place="margin">Note.</note> towards the obteyning of an <hi>Vnion</hi> of the ſoule with God, by the bond of perfect loue; and theſe, belong to the <hi>Vnitiue way.</hi> And this they ordayne, to the end that euery one, may imploy himſelfe in that <hi>exerciſe,</hi> which is moſt agreable, and fit for his owne diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſtate.</p>
               <p>But yet know this the while; that how perfect ſoeuer a man be, he may ſafely exerciſe himſelfe in ſorrow for his ſinnes, and in deſiring pardon of God for them, and begging grace that he may neuer offend him, and this wilbe a very good Exerciſe of his mind, and very acceptable to God. And both he, and that other man, who is ſtill procuring but to <hi>purge</hi> his ſoule from vice, and inordinate affections; &amp; he alſo, who laboureth to obteyne <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:173307:156"/>may alſo exerciſe himſelfe in acts of the <hi>Loue of God,</hi> to make that other <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,</hi> which he is chiefly about, more eaſy and ſweete. Therfore all men may imploye themſelues, ſometymes, in this <hi>purgatiue exerciſe,</hi> by making ſuch <hi>Acts</hi> as theſe: <hi>O Lord, that I had neuer offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee. Do not permit, O my Lord, thus euer I may offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thee any more. Let me dye as much as thou wilt, but neuer let me ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee. Let is pleaſe thy diuine maieſty, that I may rather die a thouſand deaths, them euer commit one mortall ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At other tymes, one may raiſe his hart to God, by giuing him thankes for all his benefits, both generall and particuler, which he hath receiued; or els by begging the gifte of ſome <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;</hi> ſometymes profound <hi>humility;</hi> at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tymes <hi>perfect Obedience;</hi> at other ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, <hi>Patience;</hi> at others, <hi>Charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Agayne, at other tymes, a man may raiſe his mind to God, by acts of <hi>loue,</hi> and <hi>conformity</hi> to his moſt holy will, ſaying this, or the like.<note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> that when we produce theſe <hi>Acts</hi> ſaying: <hi>For thee O Lord, do I this; For thy loue; Becauſe thou wilt haue it ſo,</hi> &amp; the like; we are to do them, and ſay them, as one who ſpeakes to God, already <hi>preſent;</hi> and not as one, who raiſeth his hart, or his thought, to ſend it far off, or without himſelfe. This aduiſe is of great importance in this <hi>Exerciſe.</hi> For this is properly, to go in the <hi>Preſence of God,</hi> and this is that, which makes this <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> eaſy, and ſweete, and which makes it moue, and profit more. Yea, euen in our other Prayers, when we meditate of Chriſt vpon the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> or at the <hi>Pillar;</hi> they who treate of <hi>Prayer,</hi> giue counſaile, that we ſhould not <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,</hi> that to be at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and that it paſſed, a thouſand, and ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares agoe; for this wearyes more, and moues leſſe: But we are to imagine it, as preſent, where we are; &amp; that it paſſeth there before vs; and that we heare the ſtrokes of the ſcourges, &amp; the knocks of the hammers.

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:173307:159"/>meditate the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of <hi>death;</hi> they ſay that we are to imagine, that we are already vpon the point to dye, and giuen ouer by the <hi>Phyſitians;</hi> and with the <hi>holy candle</hi> in our hand. How much more reaſon then, ſhall it be, that in this <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of the <hi>Preſence of God,</hi> we performe thoſe <hi>acts,</hi> which we haue named, not as men, who ſpeake with an abſent perſon, and that far off from vs; but as men who ſpeake with God <hi>preſent;</hi> ſince the very <hi>Exerciſe</hi> it ſelfe, requires it, and in reality of <hi>Truth,</hi> he is <hi>Preſent.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>TO the end that we may the better ſee the perfection, and profit of this <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> and way of going in the <hi>Preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God</hi> which we haue ſhewed; and to the end that it may be the more declared,<note place="margin">Note.</note> we will touch ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and aduantages, which there
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:173307:160"/>are therein. The firſt is this. In the other <hi>Exerciſes</hi> of the <hi>Preſence of God,</hi> which ſome vſe to propound; all ſeemes to be but an <hi>act</hi> of the <hi>Vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> and all ſeemes to end in this, that they <hi>imagine the Preſence of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> preſuppoſeth, this <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>vnderstanding,</hi> &amp; of <hi>fayth, That God is preſent,</hi> and then it goes further on, and maketh <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Loue of God;</hi> and in theſe, it doth principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. And this doth euidently appeare, to be better, and more profitable then the former. Iuſt ſo, as we ſaid in the <hi>Treatiſe of Prayer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tract.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 14.</note> that we are not to dwell in the <hi>acts</hi> of the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> which is the <hi>Meditation,</hi> and <hi>Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of things; but in the <hi>acts</hi> of the <hi>Will,</hi> that is, in the <hi>affects</hi> and <hi>deſires</hi> of <hi>vertue,</hi> and the <hi>imitation of Chriſt our Lord;</hi> and this is to be of the <hi>fruite</hi> of <hi>Prayer.</hi> And ſo heere, the chiefe and beſt, and moſt profitable part of this <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> conſiſts in the <hi>acts</hi> of the <hi>will;</hi> and this is that, wherupon we muſt inſiſt moſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond benefit which followes vpon this <hi>Exerciſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> is that it is more ſweet, and facill, then the reſt. For to
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:173307:160"/>thoſe others, is neceſſary diſcourſe, and labour of the <hi>vnderſtanding,</hi> and <hi>imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to repreſent <hi>formes</hi> before it; which is the thing, that vſeth to weary, and to breake the braynes, and therfore it cannot laſt ſo longe. Whereas towards this <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> there is no neede of <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,</hi> but of <hi>affects,</hi> and <hi>acts</hi> of the <hi>will,</hi> which are produced without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For although it be true, that there is ſome <hi>act</hi> of the <hi>Vnderſtanding,</hi> euen there; yet that, is preſuppoſed by <hi>Fayth,</hi> without wearying vs therby. And as when we adore the <hi>B. Sacrament,</hi> we preſuppoſe by <hi>Fayth,</hi> that Chriſt our Lord is <hi>preſent</hi> there; and all our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and imployment is, in adoring, reuering, louing, and begging fauours of that Lord, whome we know to be <hi>preſent;</hi> ſo it is in this <hi>Exerciſe.</hi> And from hence alſo it is, that the ſame, being more facill, one may continue, and perſeuere in it, longer tyme. For euen to ſick perſons, who are not capable of any other <hi>Prayer,</hi> we are wont to aduiſe, that they are often to lift vp their harts to God, with ſome <hi>affects</hi> &amp; <hi>acts</hi> of the <hi>Will,</hi> becauſe they may be
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:173307:161"/>produced with facility. And therfore, although there were no other aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage belonging to this <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that one may continue, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere in it, longer tyme, then in the reſt; we ſhould haue reaſon, to eſteeme it much, and therfore how much more, are we to do it, hauing ſo many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages beſides.</p>
               <p>The third, and principall thinge, &amp; that which we are to obſerue very well, is: That <hi>the Preſence of God</hi> is not only conſidered, to the end, that we may dwell in that; but to the end, that it may ſerue vs, for a meanes to do thoſe other things well, which we are to performe. For if we ſhould content our ſelues, with hauing an attention to <hi>the preſence of God,</hi> and therby did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect our workes themſelues, and did performe them with faults; this would be no good <hi>deuotion,</hi> but an <hi>illuſion.</hi> We are alwayes to make account, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we carry one of our eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his diuine Maieſty, we muſt place the other, vpon the worke it ſelfe; that we may performe it well, for the loue of him. And our ſeeing, that
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:173307:161"/>we ſtand in the <hi>Preſence of God,</hi> muſt be the meanes, to make vs do all that, which we are to do, the better, and with the more perfection. And this, is much better done by this <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> then by others. For in the performing of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> is much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, about thoſe <hi>corporall ſigures,</hi> which a man hath a mynde to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore himſelfe, or about thoſe <hi>conceytes</hi> which he will drawe out of that, which he hath preſent to him; and whilſt he will needs drawe this, or that good conſideration from thence, many tymes he markes not well, what he is doing, and ſo he falls out to do it ill.</p>
               <p>But this <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> ſince it buſieth not the <hi>Vnderſtanding,</hi> doth not hinder, any way, the good performance of the workes; but rather it doth greatly hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe, that they may be exactly done. For he is doing them, for the loue of God; and in the <hi>Preſence of God,</hi> who lookes vpon him. And ſo he procures to do them, in ſuch ſort, and ſo well, as that they may be fit to appeare before the eyes of that diuine Maieſty; and that
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:173307:162"/>there may be nothing therein, which is vnworthy of his <hi>Preſence.</hi> Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which,<note place="margin">Tract. c. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> we ſpake elſe where, of another point, which ſheweth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of going in the <hi>Preſence of God,</hi> which is very good and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and recommended by the Saynts; and therfore we will forbeare to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate it heere.</p>
